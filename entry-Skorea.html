      Traveling to South Korea on a university exchange was one of the most life-changing experiences I’ve ever had. As someone who had never lived outside my home country, I was both excited and nervous stepping off the plane at Incheon International Airport. The energy of Seoul was immediate—from the neon-lit streets to the rhythmic chaos of subway stations, everything felt new, vibrant, and alive.

      My exchange wasn't just about studying—it was a chance to learn how to live differently. I had to navigate a new education system, communicate in a language I was still learning, and adapt to social customs that were unfamiliar but fascinating. I quickly discovered how hospitable and kind Korean people are, whether it was a fellow student helping me find a classroom or a shopkeeper teaching me how to pronounce a word in Korean.

      Beyond campus, I immersed myself in the culture—visiting palaces, attending traditional festivals, and even hiking in the chilly autumn air to see the changing leaves on Namsan Mountain. I developed a deep love for Korean food, especially dishes like bibimbap, sundubu-jjigae, and hotteok on cold nights from street vendors. Each meal was a story, a memory.

      Living in Korea challenged me to be independent, resilient, and open-minded. It taught me that growth happens outside your comfort zone, and that even the awkward or difficult moments have a way of shaping who you become. I returned home with more than just memories—I came back with a broader worldview, new friendships, and a deeper understanding of myself.
