**Living In Between** is more than just a blog. It’s a visual, interactive experience focused on sharing travel stories, everyday life moments, and cultural connections. Key features include:

- **Animated “Flower Shower” Background**  
  Subtle falling frangipani petals create a calm, dreamy backdrop using HTML5 canvas animation.

- **Dynamic Mood Toggle**  
  A “Press me” button instantly changes the site’s background to a new pastel colour palette.

- **Flip-Clock Countdown Timer**  
  Shows a live countdown to the next planned trip, with animated days, hours, minutes, and seconds.

- **Travel Map with Interactive Pins**  
  A map highlights places visited so far, with custom icons and pop-up notes about each destination.

- **Polaroid-Style Photo Carousel**  
  Horizontally scrolling “polaroid” cards display memorable travel moments, each with playful captions.

- **Modal Lightbox for Photos**  
  Click any photo to enlarge it and view its caption in a stylish modal overlay.

- **Typing Animation for Welcome Message**  
  Rotating header text types out a series of friendly intro phrases.

- **Random Fun Fact Display**  
  Each page load shows a different travel tip or fun fact at the top of the site.

- **Image Gallery Filters**  
  Buttons allow visitors to filter photos by country or trip, instantly reorganizing the grid.
